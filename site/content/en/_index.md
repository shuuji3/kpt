Kpt (pronounced “kept”) is an OSS tool for building declarative workflows
on top of resource configuration.

Its git + YAML architecture means it just works with existing tools,
frameworks, and platforms.

Kpt includes solutions to fetch, display, customize, update, validate, and
apply Kubernetes configuration.
